The newly renovated Lomond Campground is the perfect place to disconnect from your busy life and reconnect with nature. Located on the shores of Bonne Bay, it is surrounded by forest and offers stunning salt water and mountain views. Enjoy a campfire under a night sky spread large above Killdevil mountain. Wander trails through the tallest forest in Gros Morne while enjoying bird songs and wildflowers. A dock and boat launch provide access to the East Arm of Bonne Bay, so bring your “water toys'' and enjoy boating, kayaking or paddle boarding right from the campground.    
  
Nestled into the Lomond River valley, the campground is in the Southeast region of the Park. It provides close access for hiking or mountain biking on Stuckless Pond Trail, and for salmon fishing on the Lomond River. It’s a great base for exploring the South side of the Park including the Discovery Center, Lookout Trail, the Tablelands and nearby towns.

## Trout River
Opens Fri 6 June, 2025
At Gros Morne’s southern end, nestled on the edge of glacier-carved Trout River Pond and overlooking the iconic Tablelands, you’ll find Trout River Campground. Rooted in the forest, it is surrounded by a landscape of striking geology and a spectacular night sky. Campsites are nestled into the trees for privacy and protection from the wind. The campground provides close access to Trout River Pond for boating, kayaking, and hiking, and the Tablelands for iconic views and exceptional hiking experiences. At night, unwind around the campfire, or enjoy the pristine, star-studded sky.   
  
The campground is just 2 km from the town of Trout River, and a good base for exploring the south side of the Park. After a day of exploring the Tablelands, or a hike at Green Gardens, dine in the nearby fishing community of Trout River and stroll along the boardwalk on the waterfront.    
  
Wooded campsites, un-serviced campsites, oTENTiks, and small cabins. Kitchen shelter, flush toilets, shower facilities, fire pits on all sites, kiosk. Nearby day-use-area has a playground, boat launch, hiking trail, and freshwater swimming.
